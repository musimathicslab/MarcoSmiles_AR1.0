# MarcoSmiles AR 1.0

MarcoSmiles AR 1.0 is a distributed client–server augmented reality (AR) platform designed for musical interaction and performance. The system leverages a Meta Quest headset for real-time hand tracking and visualization, while heavy computation, including model training and inference, is offloaded to a high-performance server.

## Overview

- **Platform:** Meta Quest 3 headset (AR), high-performance server for computation
- **Purpose:** Enable natural, immersive music creation while addressing limitations of Leap Motion-based prototypes
- **Key Features:**
  - Distributed client–server architecture
  - Real-time gesture recognition in AR
  - Offloading of training and inference to external server
  - MIDI output for integration with external DAWs such as Ableton Live and FL Studio

## Experimental Study

A user study was conducted with 14 participants (ages 20–60) possessing varying levels of musical and XR experience. Participants tested both MarcoSmiles Double Leap (Leap Motion-based) and MarcoSmiles AR (Meta Quest 3-based) systems.  
Assessment tools included:
- Personal Data and Satisfaction Questionnaire (custom)
- User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)
- Profile of Mood States – Short Form (POMS-SF)

**Results:**
- MarcoSmiles AR 1.0 was preferred overall compared to the Leap Motion prototype
- Higher ratings in usability, immersion, and satisfaction
- Qualitative insights from an ALS user informed further design considerations:
  - Simplified interaction and setup
  - Optimized system fluidity
  - Integration with existing music production platforms
